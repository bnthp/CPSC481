            <h2>Project Idea</h2>

            <p>
              When you're trying to figure out a time that all your friends are free so you can plan a meetup, it can be difficult and annoying to get all their schedules and manually figure out the best time and day. Team One’s aim is to design a scheduling application that visually displays times people are “busy” so you can easily find out when people aren’t busy. You can then mark the schedule with that event so everyone in the group can see.
            </p>
            <p>
              The application will be an Android mobile app and is targeted towards youth and young adults (ages 12 to 45) who have difficulties trying to find the optimal time and day to schedule an event. We expect people who have friends in different time zones (i.e. online friends) to also use this application.

            <h1>User Research Methods</h1>
              <p>The two user research methods used were <b>survey</b> and <b>narration</b>.
              </p>
            </br></br>
            <h2>Survey</h2>
              <p>Our first research method was making a survey. The reasoning for this was so we could get a good idea whether people would actually want to use a a scheduling app for groups, what kind of basic functionality people would like to see in the app, and what kind of issues people face when using scheduling apps.</p>
            <h2>Survey Summary</h2>
              <p>The first few questions we asked concern a user demographic, we wanted to see things like what kind of age group is interested in the product and what they're interested in doing. To get this idea we ask what kind of events they're usually involved with, ie iterative types of events and unique events. We also ask what sized group potential users usually make events for and how often they make these events. These questions give us a difference between using the app with a small group of friends that want to see how each others lives fit together vs a larger group trying to plan events that fit around everyone's schedule.
              </p>
              <p>From the results we found that about 80% of the people that took the survey were young adults between the ages of 16 and 24, and that about the same amount (85%) were interested in actually using the group scheduling app. This might imply a correlation between age and need. We also see that a large majority of the use cases for people would be unique events with a small(~5) group of people. These results can help us narrow down an appropriate target audience to cater our design choices to, and tell us what the most important kind of functionality for the app would be.
              </p>
              <p>We then asked people the reasoning behind their group plans failing to follow through and we saw that it's majorly because some people couldn't attend or because the group couldn't communicate properly. This result justifies the reasoning we initially had behind the app. What we're trying to do is eliminate the lack of proper communication and make it easier for groups of people to understand each others schedules and plan properly around them. This result shows that these actually are major problems that people are facing right now.
              </p>
              <p>What we asked last was peoples preferences on how to invite others and how much detail people wanted when creating an event. The reasoning behind this is to allow us to cater some of the core functionality to what users would actually want. We found that the preferred method for inviting people isn't very clear at all, with most options having equal weighting (~50% of people said they would like to use any of; their contact list, an invite through the app, direct link) aside from invite by email which held little weight (~20% of people said they would use this method). In terms of event customization there were 4 consistent functionalities that almost all people want; a name for the event, a description, a location, and a list of attendants. Other options like receiving push notification and being able to have event pictures were less widely received. This result is a good indication of what our prominent features should be and what should possibly be hidden options.
              </p>

           </br></br>
            <h2>Narration</h2>
              <p>We decided to do a narrative with some select people so that we could see what they actually try to do when faced with a task. This complements the survey that was mainly shallow evaluation, with a more in depth user response. This helps up see what the flow of information looks like in someone's hand and whether its intuitive to the people using it. We also wanted to get information regarding what people like or didn't like or what people thought was intuitive when using a scheduling app.
              </p>
            <h2>Narration findings and highlights</h2>
              <p>split 50/50 between people clicking the day to make an event and people clicking the + at the bottom to make an event.</p>

no one has problems with filling out event information

people don't like closing an event then having to open it again for some reason (ie, changing times)

when people have to do anything that might seem fairly complicated the first place they look is the menu

most people don't find it intuitive to swipe an event to make it do anything (only 1 person did this as an exhaustive means to try and share it, and it deleted the event)

people don't like, and generally don't feel a need to schedule things far in advance (further than maybe a month or 2 in advance)

first thing people seem to do to try and change the view (day, month, year) is to look in the menu. This might be from their experience - the only person i observed to try and finger flick between views was someone who's never used a planner before.
