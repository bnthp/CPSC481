            <h2>Project Idea</h2>

            <p>
              When you're trying to figure out a time that all your friends are free so you can plan a meetup, it can be difficult and annoying to get all their schedules and manually figure out the best time and day. Team One’s aim is to design a scheduling application that visually displays times people are “busy” so you can easily find out when people aren’t busy. You can then mark the schedule with that event so everyone in the group can see.
            </p>
            <p>
              The application will be an Android mobile app and is targeted towards youth and young adults (ages 12 to 45) who have difficulties trying to find the optimal time and day to schedule an event. We expect people who have friends in different time zones (i.e. online friends) to also use this application.

            <h1>Stakeholders and users</h1>
              <p>Our stakeholders are also our end-users: people who will have used a mobile app (probably Android, since our app will be Android compatible only) and understand how a schedule or calendar app works. They may also be people who have never used such an app before.
                We expect our end-users to be youth and young adults who want to arrange events with friends, but find that their friends often have conflicting schedules, thus they have trouble finding times when everyone is free.
                In addition, their friends may live in different time zones (i.e. are online friends) and so they find it difficult and tedious to calculate time differences.

            <h1>User Research Methods</h1>
              <p>The two user research methods used were <b>survey</b> and <b>narration</b>.
              </p>
            </br></br>
            <h2>Survey</h2>
              <p>Our first research method was making a survey. The reasoning for this was so we could get a good idea whether people would actually want to use a a scheduling app for groups, what kind of basic functionality people would like to see in the app, and what kind of issues people face when using scheduling apps.</p>
            </br></br>
            <h2>Survey Questions</h2>
            <p>The survey was conducted using Google Forms. There were 61 participants.</p>
            <ul class="list">

            <h2>Survey Summary</h2>
              <p>The first few questions we asked concern a user demographic, we wanted to see things like what kind of age group is interested in the product and what they're interested in doing. To get this idea we ask what kind of events they're usually involved with, ie iterative types of events and unique events. We also ask what sized group potential users usually make events for and how often they make these events. These questions give us a difference between using the app with a small group of friends that want to see how each others lives fit together vs a larger group trying to plan events that fit around everyone's schedule.
              </p>
              <p>From the results we found that about 80% of the people that took the survey were young adults between the ages of 16 and 24, and that about the same amount (85%) were interested in actually using the group scheduling app. This might imply a correlation between age and need. We also see that a large majority of the use cases for people would be unique events with a small(~5) group of people. These results can help us narrow down an appropriate target audience to cater our design choices to, and tell us what the most important kind of functionality for the app would be.
              </p>
              <p>We then asked people the reasoning behind their group plans failing to follow through and we saw that it's majorly because some people couldn't attend or because the group couldn't communicate properly. This result justifies the reasoning we initially had behind the app. What we're trying to do is eliminate the lack of proper communication and make it easier for groups of people to understand each others schedules and plan properly around them. This result shows that these actually are major problems that people are facing right now.
              </p>
              <p>What we asked last was peoples preferences on how to invite others and how much detail people wanted when creating an event. The reasoning behind this is to allow us to cater some of the core functionality to what users would actually want. We found that the preferred method for inviting people isn't very clear at all, with most options having equal weighting (~50% of people said they would like to use any of; their contact list, an invite through the app, direct link) aside from invite by email which held little weight (~20% of people said they would use this method). In terms of event customization there were 4 consistent functionalities that almost all people want; a name for the event, a description, a location, and a list of attendants. Other options like receiving push notification and being able to have event pictures were less widely received. This result is a good indication of what our prominent features should be and what should possibly be hidden options.
              </p>
            </br></br>

            <h2>Narration</h2>
              <p>We decided to do a narrative with some select people so that we could see what they actually try to do when faced with a task. This complements the survey that was mainly shallow evaluation, with a more in depth user response. This helps up see what the flow of information looks like in someone's hand and whether its intuitive to the people using it. We also wanted to get information regarding what people like or didn't like or what people thought was intuitive when using a scheduling app.
              </p>

            </br></br>
            <h2>Narration questions</h2>
            (These are the instructions we gave to the interviewees)</br></br>
            <p>Attempt the following. Please describe the steps you are taking, and your thought process. If you are unable to complete any of the tasks, tell us your thoughts.
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Make a group.</li>
                <li>Make an event with the name “Canada Day breakfast” on today’s date at “9:00am to 12:00pm” at the “Stampede Grounds”.</li>
                <li>Change the event date to July 1, 2018.</li>
                <li>Find the event in your calendar.</li>
                <li>Change the event name “Canada Day Breakfast” to “Canada Day Dinner”, with the new time at “6:00pm to 8:00pm”.</li>
                <li>Invite someone to the calendar.</li>
                <li>Try and share the event.</li>
                <li>Show the event details to me.</li>

                <li>Delete the event.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>

            </br></br>
            <h2>Narration findings and highlights</h2>
              <p>Our narration involved interviewing six individuals and asking them to perform a series of tasks on the Google calendar app, such as adding an event, modifying its details, and deleting the event. We closely examined how users would try to navigate through the application to find an event they added (displaying the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly views), how they displayed event details to our interviewers, and also recorded their reactions when we asked them to perform pretty unorthodox tasks such as making a group of people who could view the calendar and sharing the details of an event to a contact via the app.
              </p>
              <p>When asked to make an event on the app, three people found it intuitive to press the + button on the bottom right hand corner of the screen. Filling in, modifying event information, and showing the details to our interviewers was straightforward for them. They would click the pencil icon to modify an event and the trash can to delete it. One person deleted their event two different ways on two different instances we asked them to delete it: the first time they clicked the pencil icon, the three dots icon, and then deleted it; the second time they used the trash can icon.
              </p>
              <p>A couple of people expressed frustration when asked to repeatedly modify details of the event or delete it; this is not because it was difficult, but because asking them annoyed them. And although we did not think to have them explore the search function in the app, one person used it because they had difficulty finding their event before editing it (and discovered they had entered the wrong date we asked them to enter). Two people ended up entering the information wrong because of the dropdown selector within the app.
              </p>
              <p>When changing the granularity of the calendar view (day, week, month, year), three people found it intuitive to open the menu to find the option to change views. One person, who said they had never used a calendar app before, attempted to flick their finger across the screen to change views.
              </p>
              <p>When asked to create a group or share the event, most participants’ first reaction was to open the menu and scroll through the options. Two individuals who declared they were advanced users knew how to share the event with others and went directly to the option without much searching. Others took more time. One person swiped their finger across the event and accidentally deleted it.
              </p>
              <p>Some other comments we received during the narrations included an inconvenience that only Gmail users were available to share the event with. Another commenter mentioned that they felt discomfort when filling in a location, the app suggests the most recent places the user has been to.

            <h1>Post Research Reflection</h1>
            <p>In this section, we will discuss what went well, what went poorly, and what we should have done differently after conducting the user research methods above.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the survey questions we asked initially were confusing, our participants didn't understand some of the questions. Since some who filled out the survey were friends of ours, they tended not to take it seriously and gave us ridiculous or false answers which skewed the data until we cleaned them out. Apart from that, the people that answered properly seemed to give good feedback that helped us in showing what was important in the app.
            </p>
            <p>During the narratives, we noticed throughout the process that some of the instructions and questions were not as well thought out as they should have been. A better approach to take in the future is to test the narrative questions on a member of the group before gathering results from participants.
            </p>
            <p>There was a fairly major flaw with the narratives: though we asked them to, most people didn't voice their thoughts and actions out loud while they used the calendar app. This resulted in it not being as much of a narration as we wanted to be, which is probably because people don't like thinking out loud especially when they think a task is fairly simple. On the positive side,  we could still see the people’s hand movements and how they interacted with the app as well as what they found intuitive to do, it gave us some insight on user flow within the app. People did say small phrases when something was particularly annoying or difficult, which we consider useful feedback for what to focus on even though the methodology didn't go the way we wanted it to go. Overall, the narration research was fairly successful, even though it didn't go as planned. A lot of insight was gained through both user research methods.
