            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>

            <p>
              The goal of this project was to produce a lightweight product that would allow people to coordinate their schedules and find common availability times. Although most calendar apps could be used for this purpose, full calendar apps tend to be bulky and inconvenient for small or quick meet-ups. Because of this, we sought out to develop a new app that focused on ease of use and convenience and that provided only the essential information for a group of people planning to get together.
            </p><p>
              Through our survey and narrative analysis, we confirmed that there was a need for this system and found the key features people wanted in a scheduling app. Using the user data gathered, we produced several sketches and prototypes which culminated in our current design. When we tested this design with users we found that the core functionality and workflow of the app met expectations, but that improvements were needed to a few areas such as the tutorial, button spacing, and differentiation between group and personal calendar view. Given the feedback it is likely our app would be in its final state within one or two more prototypes and in its current state, it is successful with room for improvement.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              When you're trying to figure out a time that all your friends are free so you can plan a meetup, it can be difficult and annoying to get all their schedules and manually figure out the best time and day. Team One’s aim is to design a scheduling application that visually displays times people are “busy” so you can easily find out when people aren’t busy. You can then mark the schedule with that event so everyone in the group can see.

            <h1>Design Problem</h1>
              <p>
                When trying to get together with a group of friends, everyone in the group needs to know what are possible available times and then agree and communicate a decision once it is reached. This is typically done either through written text, which can be hard to visualize, or sharing a calendar, which can be cumbersome and inconvenient. Our design problem was to create a system which would allow people to share their availability in an intuitive way while also make it lightweight and most of all, convenient.

            <h1>User Research and Findings</h1>
              <p>
                We performed user research through two forms of investigation, a broad survey, and a focused narrative observation. Through the 61 survey responses we received, we discovered ~85% of people are looking for an app like the one we wanted to build, ~77% of people tend to have one day events, and seldomly do people plan to get together with more than 5 people. The survey also yielded some information on what features people consider the most important when creating events. The narrative we performed focused on finding the key features people struggle with when using a conventional calendar app. By doing this, we could anticipate and avoid making the same mistakes that currently dissuade people from using calendar apps.

            <h1>Design and Justification</h1>
            <p>
              The design of our app focused on minimalism and ease of use. From our narrative observations we noticed that things like multiple menus and nested pages produced confusion and a poor user experience as users often did not select the correct menu of the first try. This led us to try to minimize the number of options presented to the user and keep the interface as clean as possible. Additionally because of the survey results that the vast majority had 5 or less people when getting together, we focused our friend and group management to accommodate actions done to a single person such as toggling their calendar on/off rather than things like adding/removing multiple people at once.

            <h1>Heuristic Evaluation and Findings</h1>
            <p>
              Our heuristic evaluation found we were successful where we had tried the hardest with “minimalist design” and “consistency and standards” being our best traits. We struggle however with “visibility of system status”, because the prototype is not particularly conducive to this, and “flexibility and efficiency of use”, mostly because the simplicity of the app allows few areas to introduce advanced user options. Apart from these we also noticed an issue with “help and documentation”, not because our system was complex and hard to use, but because we never provided the user with information on what the app was and how/why they should use it.

            <p>
              Given the simplicity of the system there are only a few key places where error prevention is needed. It was implemented successfully during account creation by having it ask to retype the password to ensure no slips by the user. Less successful error prevention was present when canceling an event creation. Although it does produce a confirmation prompt when canceling, the prompt is poorly worded and hard to determine which button will cancel the event and which will allow continued editing.

            <h1>Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design</h1>
            <p>
              As the app mostly revolves around one screen, little recollection is required. The group/personal calendar state is viewable in the top right, and the busy-ness of a day is recognizable by how <b>darkly shaded</b> the day is on the calendar.
              Both these features  can be easily be recognized instead of opening other dialog windows to check. The only view that does requires recall is the event creation as it fill the entire screen preventing viewing of the calendar but requires information from the calendar to know when people are available.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
              From the feedback of user testing, the app development thus far has been successful, but still requires further refinement. The core features and designs implemented have produced the desired user-flow and show our investigation was successful with no need to return to the ideation phase at this point. The minor details however could be changed to produce a better user experience and likely one or two more prototype phases are needed to address layout issues and clerical errors. The app in its current state solves the design issue we had aimed for and we believe we both built the right thing, and built the thing right, but as with most products there is always room for improvement.
