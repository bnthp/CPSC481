            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>

            <p>
              The goal of this project was to produce a lightweight product that would allow people to coordinate their schedules and find common availability times. Although most calendar apps could be used for this purpose, full calendar apps tend to be bulky and inconvenient for small or quick meet-ups. Because of this, we sought out to develop a new app that focused on ease of use and convenience and that provided only the essential information for a group of people planning to get together.
            </p><p>
              Through our survey and narrative analysis, we confirmed that there was a need for this system and found the key features people wanted in a scheduling app. Using the user data gathered, we produced several sketches and prototypes which culminated in our current design. When we tested this design with users we found that the core functionality and workflow of the app met expectations, but that improvements were needed to a few areas such as the tutorial, button spacing, and differentiation between group and personal calendar view. Given the feedback it is likely our app would be in its final state within one or two more prototypes and in its current state, it is successful with room for improvement.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              When you're trying to figure out a time that all your friends are free so you can plan a meetup, it can be difficult and annoying to get all their schedules and manually figure out the best time and day. Team One’s aim is to design a scheduling application that visually displays times people are “busy” so you can easily find out when people aren’t busy. You can then mark the schedule with that event so everyone in the group can see.

            <h1>Design Problem</h1>
              <p>
                When trying to get together with a group of friends, everyone in the group needs to know what are possible available times and then agree and communicate a decision once it is reached. This is typically done either through written text, which can be hard to visualize, or sharing a calendar, which can be cumbersome and inconvenient. Our design problem was to create a system which would allow people to share their availability in an intuitive way while also make it lightweight and most of all, convenient.

            <h1>User Research and Findings</h1>
              <p>
                We performed user research through two forms of investigation, a broad survey, and a focused narrative observation. Through the 61 survey responses we received, we discovered ~85% of people are looking for an app like the one we wanted to build, ~77% of people tend to have one day events, and seldomly do people plan to get together with more than 5 people. The survey also yielded some information on what features people consider the most important when creating events. The narrative we performed focused on finding the key features people struggle with when using a conventional calendar app. By doing this, we could anticipate and avoid making the same mistakes that currently dissuade people from using calendar apps.

            <h1>Design and Justification</h1>
            <p>
              The design of our app focused on minimalism and ease of use. From our narrative observations we noticed that things like multiple menus and nested pages produced confusion and a poor user experience as users often did not select the correct menu of the first try. This led us to try to minimize the number of options presented to the user and keep the interface as clean as possible. Additionally because of the survey results that the vast majority had 5 or less people when getting together, we focused our friend and group management to accommodate actions done to a single person such as toggling their calendar on/off rather than things like adding/removing multiple people at once.

            <h1>Heuristic Evaluation and Findings</h1>
            <p>
              Our heuristic evaluation found we were successful where we had tried the hardest with “minimalist design” and “consistency and standards” being our best traits. We struggle however with “visibility of system status”, because the prototype is not particularly conducive to this, and “flexibility and efficiency of use”, mostly because the simplicity of the app allows few areas to introduce advanced user options. Apart from these we also noticed an issue with “help and documentation”, not because our system was complex and hard to use, but because we never provided the user with information on what the app was and how/why they should use it.

              The "three vertical dots" icon was used for both user and group settings, an icon commonly found in other applications to represent opening smaller menus.</figcaption>

            <h1>User Testing and Findings</h1>
            <p>
              Given the simplicity of the system there are only a few key places where error prevention is needed. It was implemented successfully during account creation by having it ask to retype the password to ensure no slips by the user. Less successful error prevention was present when canceling an event creation. Although it does produce a confirmation prompt when canceling, the prompt is poorly worded and hard to determine which button will cancel the event and which will allow continued editing.

            <h2>Highlights from usability testing</h2>
            <p>Six users participated in the usability testing.</p>
            <h3>Going through the tutorial</h3>

            <p>
            Users found that the wording in the tutorials was confusing, and should be restructured. The pictures are difficult to see as well, users with reduced eyesight found it very difficult because the images were full-sized screenshots, and the arrows pointing to objects of interest were blending in with the background of the screenshot.
            </p>

            </figure>


            <br/><br/>
            <h3>Adding people as friends and putting them into a group</h3>
            <p>Adding a friend went well, some users needed explanation as to what the unique identifier was (name + unique generated number). Making a group was confusing because users were accustomed to the usage of the + button as adding an event. In the menu we use the same + button in a contextual block with the group images to imply that its used to add a group, this misinterpretation was generally fixed quickly.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img class="img_cell" src="img/add friend.png" class="img_cell">
              <figcaption><b>Figure 12.</b> Screenshot from the prototype displaying the "add friend" functionality. The input field hint contains a sample user tag (unique identifier).</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Adding to a group lead almost every user to complain, the method used only allows to add 1 friend to a group at a time and required 2 clicks. You click a friend’s name and then click the add button that pops up. The add button was red so it made mot people initially think that, while in the screen, one would select all the friends they want to add to the group and that the red add button was a remove button used to change your mind about adding a friend (this was most prevalent for a visual impaired user). When removing a friend from a group users didn’t know what to do because they functionality was to swipe a friend in the group and then click the remove button, there possibly needs to be some indication of functionality added.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <h3>Setting up an event (for yourself and for a group)</h3>
            <p>
              When setting up a busy time in the individual calendar there weren’t many issues apart from the point that most people tried pressing the date on the screen instead of the + button used to add events. One individual tried looking within the menu for the functionality as well.
            </p>

            <p>
When users moved to the group view to make an event for a group of people, they had more trouble because the two different calendar views look the same apart from the icon of a group of people at the top. People assumed that the calendar was still the individual one so they did not realize that the + button at the bottom was now to add a group event. Most people looked in the menu and eventually tried the + button after not being able to find anything, or were given an explanation and were surprised. This means that our method of identifying the individual and group calendars is not efficient enough, no one even noticed the change in the icon at the top of the screen because the change was minimal.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img class="img_cell" src="img/new header colour.png" class="img_cell">
              <figcaption><b>Figure 12.</b> The top image shows the old heading colour we had for the group calendar page, which was the exact same as the user calendar header colour. After the usability testing, the group calendar header colour
              was modified to a darker shade to help users differentiate better between the <b>user calendar</b> and <b>group calendar</b>.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              When describing the event in the event creation page some users had troubles remembering specific dates and said that it would be helpful to at lest see a small display of the calendar so they could remind themselves of relative dates, one user had to exit the event creation to double check when a specific date was.
            </p><p>
              When discarding an event, the popup asking whether "the user was sure" came up, and most users thought it was unnecessary since the functionality was simple enough to not merit the check.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
              From the feedback of user testing, the app development thus far has been successful, but still requires further refinement. The core features and designs implemented have produced the desired user-flow and show our investigation was successful with no need to return to the ideation phase at this point. The minor details however could be changed to produce a better user experience and likely one or two more prototype phases are needed to address layout issues and clerical errors. The app in its current state solves the design issue we had aimed for and we believe we both built the right thing, and built the thing right, but as with most products there is always room for improvement.
